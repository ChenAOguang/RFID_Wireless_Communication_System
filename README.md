## RFID Wireless Communication System Design

In recent days, attraction for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) applications are increasing. 
Especially this system commonly use with Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) but nowadays increasing and 
developing wide wireless networks enables us to use these services at outdoor Location Based Services (LBS). 
Transportation, supply chain management and logistic are the main usage area of the RFID tag systems.
This project aims to enable indoor location services to shopping malls supported by RFID technology. 
The product of this project helps users with shopping by using their location information. 
Users of this product can find easily what they look for thus it can save their time. 
Moreover, users can be informed of discounts and they can purchase desired products for affordable prices. 
This project does not only aid customer but also it will assist sellers, too. 
They can advertise their products easily and give information about campaigns.
